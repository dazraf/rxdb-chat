# Kith — Brand Guidelines

## Brand Name

**Kith** — from "kith and kin," meaning friends, neighbors, and the people you choose to keep close. Not family by obligation, but community by intention.

## Tagline

**Your space. Your words. Your network.**

## Positioning

Kith is a self-hosted, offline-first discussion platform for small, intentional communities. It is not trying to be the next social network. It is the quiet alternative — software that runs on your hardware, stores data you can touch, and keeps working when the internet doesn't.

Kith exists for groups that want to own their communication: co-ops, hackerspaces, field teams, neighborhoods, reading clubs, makerspaces, local collectives. People who care enough to set something up for the people they care about.

In a landscape of platforms that are loud, extractive, and fragile, Kith is small, private, and resilient.

## Brand Pillars

### 1. Resilience

Kith works offline. Not as a fallback, not as a degraded mode — as a first-class experience. Every read and write happens locally. Sync is automatic and invisible. The server is a convenience, not a dependency.

This resilience is the foundation of trust. People can rely on Kith the way they rely on a notebook: it's always there, it always works, nothing disappears.

### 2. Ownership

Your data lives in a SQLite file you can copy with `cp`. The whole stack runs on a single machine you control. There are no accounts on someone else's platform, no terms of service, no algorithmic feed deciding what your community sees.

Ownership isn't a feature. It's the architecture.

### 3. Craft

Kith is built with care for the details that matter. Markdown that renders cleanly. A dark mode that remembers. Voice notes for when typing is too slow. File attachments that queue offline and sync later without asking.

Nothing is over-engineered. Nothing is half-finished. Every feature earns its place by being useful to small groups having real conversations.

### 4. Intimacy

Kith is designed for groups where everyone knows each other's name. There is no discovery algorithm, no trending page, no viral mechanics. The scale is intentional: small enough to be trusted, close enough to be honest.

This is a porch, not a stage.

## Voice and Tone

### Voice

Kith speaks like a competent friend who builds things. Clear, direct, unpretentious. Technical when it needs to be, human always. No jargon for its own sake. No marketing superlatives.

- **Do:** "Your data stays on your machine."
- **Don't:** "Leverage our cutting-edge local-first paradigm."

- **Do:** "Works offline. Syncs when you're back."
- **Don't:** "Seamlessly bridging connectivity gaps with intelligent sync technology."

### Tone principles

**Confident, not loud.** Kith knows what it is. It doesn't need to shout or make promises. It states facts plainly and lets people decide.

**Warm, not cute.** There's a human behind this software and you can feel it. But we don't use emoji in place of substance, and we don't try to be clever when clear will do.

**Respectful of intelligence.** Kith's users are capable people. We don't explain things they already understand. We don't dumb down. We also don't gatekeep with unnecessary complexity.

**Quiet.** The best infrastructure is the kind you forget is there. Kith's voice reflects that: present when needed, invisible when not.

## Core Message

Kith is communication infrastructure you own. It runs on your hardware, works without the internet, and puts your community's words in your community's hands. No platform risk. No data extraction. No dependencies you didn't choose.

Set it up once, hand it to your people, and forget about it. It just works.
